        <h3>Williamsburg Dimentia Consulting</h3>
        <p>
          The name of this site is
          <em>Williamsburg Dimentia Consulting</em>. The site name is a shortened version of the longer business name, "Williamsburg Dementia Consulting, llc." that offers the site visitors an insitead understanding of "What this company does and can offer me."
          This will allow visitors to have focus intent when they first visit the site.  <br /><br /> The previously used domain "https://williamsburg-dementia-consulting-llc-when-opal.business.site/" will be set up to re-direct website traffic to the new domain. Over time this will allow for printed publications, among other items, to be migrated over to reflect the new domain name. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="headline1">Purpose:</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How do I find help for my loved one with dementia?
            </li>
            <li>What else can I do for aging dementia?</li>
            <li>What is "early onset dementia"?</li>
            <li>What kind of assistance is available for someone with dementia?</li>

        <h2>Domain:</h2>
        <h3>www.dimentia-connections.com <br /></h3>
        <p>
          The site name is a shortened version of the longer business name, "Williamsburg Dementia Consulting, llc." that offers the site visitors an insitead understanding of "What this company does and can offer me."
          This will allow visitors to have focused intent when they first visit the site.
          </p>
          <p>

          This domain is shorter and easy to remember. It's more likely for a visitor to be able to remember this domain name, ultimately increasing the amount of clients able to be reached. 
        </p>
        <p>The full title/Business name will appear at the top of the website easily letting visiors know they have reached the desired destination.
          As well, full business name and city data will appear in so many other places on the site and in the meta data (the hidden data that search engines look for), that it won't affect
          search engine traffic in a negative manner, nor will it confuse the
          site visitor. Instead, it will allow them an easier name to remember
          after having seen public advetising. It will also decrease the amount
          of lost traffic due to long URL names (domain name/website address) and spelling errors. 
        </p>
        <h3>www.williamsburg-dementia-consulting-llc-when-opal.com <br /></h3>
        <p>
          This is the current domain name which is lengthy, and could be very confusing for someone trying to find the site after having seen or heard a promotion for it. However, this site can remain owned, and any website visitors that may visit can be re-directed to the new domain name. The previously used domain "https://williamsburg-dementia-consulting-llc-when-opal.business.site/" will be set up to re-direct traffic to the new domain. Over time this will allow for printed publications, among other items, to be migrated over to reflect the new domain name.

        <h2>Logo:</h2>
       
        <p class="paragraph">
          The logo combines a few enjoyable elements together: It visually
          represents the purpose of the site. It has a slight
          playful feel to it, but not  cutesie, just enough to reinforce the casual, comfortable nature of the site.
